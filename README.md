## Hi, I'm Noah!
I'm a web developer at UTSA with:
- Comprehensive knowledge in database structures
- Understanding of website layouts && CSS
- Mastery of the DOM and creating functional frontends

## Projects
I've worked/are working on a few projects on the web to better my understanding of web apps!
Some examples include:
- A twitter clone
- A functional desktop environment themed portfolio
- A piano app to visualize chords
- An art gallery, maybe for an image board
